**PAN CARD Tampering Detection Project**

The PAN CARD Tampering Detection Project is an open-source initiative aimed at developing a system to detect tampering or alterations in PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards. PAN cards are crucial identity documents used for financial and tax-related purposes, and ensuring their authenticity is of paramount importance. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify potential tampering, alterations, or counterfeit PAN cards.

## Introduction
This project is designed to detect tampering of PAN cards using computer vision techniques. It helps organizations verify the authenticity of PAN cards provided by employees, customers, or other individuals by comparing the structural similarity of the original PAN card with the user-provided PAN card.

## Features
- **Structural Similarity Calculation**: Compares the structural similarity index (SSIM) between original and user-provided PAN cards.
- **Image Processing**: Converts images to grayscale and applies thresholding to highlight differences.
- **Contours Detection**: Identifies and marks the areas of difference between the images.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual representation of the differences through marked contours.
